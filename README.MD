# rxjava


RxJava is a powerful tool for handling asynchronous and event-based programming in Android. It is an implementation of the ReactiveX library, which provides a set of operators for composing and manipulating observable sequences of data.

One of the key benefits of using RxJava in Android is that it allows you to easily create and manage complex, multi-threaded applications without having to worry about low-level threading and synchronization issues. This can significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write, and make your code more readable and maintainable.

To get started with RxJava in Android, you'll first need to add the library to your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your build.gradle file:

First, add the following dependencies to your app's build.gradle file:
```groovy

# implementation 'io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxjava:2.2.19'

# implementation 'io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxandroid:2.1.1'

```
Once you've added the library, you can start using it in your code. The most basic way to use RxJava is to create an observable sequence, which is a stream of data that you can subscribe to. For example, you can create an observable sequence of integers like this:

```java
Observable<Integer> observable = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

 ```
                
You can then subscribe to this sequence by calling the subscribe() method:


```java
observable.subscribe(new Observer<Integer>() {
  @Override
  public void onSubscribe(Disposable d) {
    // called when the subscription is made
  }

  @Override
  public void onNext(Integer value) {
    // called for each item emitted by the observable
  }

  @Override
  public void onError(Throwable e) {
    // called when an error occurs
  }

  @Override
  public void onComplete() {
    // called when the observable completes
  }
});
;
}
```  
  
As you can see, the subscribe() method takes an observer as an argument. The observer is a class that you define, which implements four methods: onSubscribe(), onNext(), onError(), and onComplete(). These methods are called by the observable sequence as it emits data.

One of the most powerful features of RxJava is the ability to compose and manipulate observable sequences using operators. There are many different operators available, including map(), filter(), flatMap(), and zip(). For example, you can use the map() operator to transform the items emitted by an observable:  
  
```java
Observable<Integer> observable = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

observable
  .map(value -> value * 2)
  .subscribe(new Observer<Integer>() {
    // ...
  });
 ```
  
In this example, the map() operator takes each item emitted by the observable and multiplies it by 2.

RxJava also has support for scheduling and threading, with Schedulers that allow you to control on which thread an operator will execute, this way you can easily perform operations on the main thread, background thread or other threads.

In summary, RxJava is a powerful tool for handling asynchronous and event-based programming in Android. It allows you to easily create and manage complex, multi-threaded applications and provides a wide range of operators for composing and manipulating observable sequences. With RxJava,
