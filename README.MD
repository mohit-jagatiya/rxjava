# rxjava


RxJava is a Java-based implementation of Reactive Programming, which is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the handling of asynchronous data streams. It is widely used in Android development for handling tasks such as network requests, database operations, and user interactions.

Here is an example of how to use RxJava in an Android application to make a network request:

First, add the following dependencies to your app's build.gradle file:

# implementation 'io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxjava:2.2.19'

# implementation 'io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxandroid:2.1.1'


Next, create an instance of the Retrofit library, which is a popular networking library for Android:


Retrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()
                .baseUrl("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/")
                .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
                .addCallAdapterFactory(RxJava2CallAdapterFactory.create())
                .build();
                
                
Create an interface for your API endpoints:


interface ApiService {
    @GET("posts")
    Single<List<Post>> getPosts();
}
  
  
In your activity or fragment, create an instance of the ApiService interface and call the desired endpoint:

  
ApiService apiService = retrofit.create(ApiService.class);
apiService.getPosts()
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(new SingleObserver<List<Post>>() {
        @Override
        public void onSubscribe(Disposable d) {
            // show progress bar
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(List<Post> posts) {
            // update UI with the received data
        }

        @Override
        public void onError(Throwable e) {
            // handle error
        }
    });
  
  
This example uses a Single observable, which emits a single item or an error, to make a GET request to a JSONPlaceholder API and retrieve a list of posts. The subscribeOn method sets the thread where the request will be made, in this case, the IO thread, and observeOn sets the thread where the result will be processed, in this case, the main thread, so that the UI can be updated.

It's important to note that, this is just a simple example, in real world application you should handle error and dispose the request in a proper way.

RxJava is a powerful tool that can simplify the handling of asynchronous tasks in Android development. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple network requests to complex data processing. However, it does have a steeper learning curve than some other libraries, so it may take some time to fully master.
